Excited to share my journey of building an Employee Management System (EMS)! 
This project was all about making HR operations smoother â€” from handling employee details, job roles, and payroll, to tracking leaves and qualifications. 
Instead of scattered information, EMS brings everything together in a centralized system that ensures accuracy and efficiency.
Like any real project, it came with its own challenges: ensuring clean and consistent data, managing complex payroll with bonuses & leave deductions, 
keeping employee data secure, and making sure the system can scale as the organization grows. Tackling these challenges not only improved the system but also sharpened my problem-solving skills.
